# YouTube Playlist Downloader
Simple server stores downloaded songs and alerts the client once all have been downloaded to the client.

Because I resent Spotify's prices this is a way to download songs from YouTube. Creating playlists in YouTube is simple so just downloading the whole playlist is easier than copying and pasting loads of differrent URLs.

Also adds correct metadata to songs to allow rich playback on device.

Basically a wrapper for `ytdl-core` and `ytpl`.
